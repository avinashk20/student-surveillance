# Student Surveillance

## Overview
The Student Surveillance project is an automated surveillance system that utilizes advanced technologies to monitor and identify students using a video stream from a camera. The system employs facial recognition to match individuals against a database of students. Upon identification, relevant parties are notified via a Telegram alert, providing details of the recognized students along with the timestamp.


## Technologies Used

- **DeepFace Library:** Used for facial recognition.
- **Dlib:** Utilized for face detection.
- **Facenet:** Employed to obtain facial embeddings for recognition.
- **MongoDB:** Storage of student details.
- **Flask:** Web framework for creating the user interface.
- **HTML and CSS:** Used to design and style the web interface.
- **Multithreading:** Implemented for efficient real-time detection.

## Features

- Real-time facial recognition using a video stream.
- Telegram alerts for identified students with timestamp details.
- Database storage for student records.
- Web interface for managing student details.
- Multithreading for efficient real-time detection.
